# ROCK PAPER SCISSORS

This project is part of [The Odin Project’s Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors). It’s a simple implementation of the classic **Rock Paper Scissors** game, built using JavaScript to practice basic programming concepts and user interaction.

### This project includes:

- A JavaScript-powered game where the player competes against the computer
- Random computer move generation using built-in JavaScript functions
- Logic to determine the winner of each round and track the score
- User prompts and console outputs

### Through this project, I practiced and demonstrated:

- Writing and organizing JavaScript functions
- Using conditionals, loops, and variables effectively
- Handling user input and generating random outputs
- Structuring a small project and debugging through the browser console
